# Gohetia_Sheldon_AJAX_Application

AJAX Application is an interactive web project designed to showcase a 3D earbuds model embedded in an HTML page using a model-viewer. This project features hotspot interactions and detailed material descriptions, which are dynamically loaded via JavaScript's fetch method from a custom-built API.

## Features

- 3D Model Integration: Display a realistic 3D model of earbuds using a model-viewer for seamless embedding and interaction.
- Dynamic Hotspot Details: Interactive hotspots on the 3D model provide detailed information about specific parts of the earbuds.
- Material Details API: Fetch material and design details from a backend API, ensuring the content is always up-to-date.
- AJAX-Powered Fetch: Leverages modern JavaScript techniques for asynchronous data loading without refreshing the page.
- Clean and Responsive Design: Ensures a smooth and engaging user experience across devices.

## Technologies

- HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling
- JavaScript for API integration and interactivity
- Model-viewer for rendering the 3D model
- AJAX for asynchronous data fetching

## Goals

This project aims to combine cutting-edge 3D modeling technology with dynamic content loading to create an immersive and educational experience for users exploring the design and materials of the earbuds.

Feel free to contribute or customize the project as needed!
